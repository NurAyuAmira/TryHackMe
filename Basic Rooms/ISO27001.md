# ISO 27001 Development Considerations

As we delve deeper into ISO 27001, it's important to understand the various aspects that an Information Security Management System (ISMS) must consider during its development phase. Below we outline critical elements that support a robust ISMS framework.

## Key Aspects of ISMS Development

### 1. People/Employees

- **Importance of Sensitization:** It is crucial to ensure that everyone within the organization understands their role in supporting the ISMS. This includes directors and administrators who should either take active roles or delegate responsibilities appropriately to ensure there is a commitment to maintaining security standards.

### 2. Technology

- **Integrating Proper Controls:** The technology stack, including cipher controls and app development processes, should align with ISMS objectives. Any third-party services used must be documented and scrutinized to ensure they meet security requirements.

### 3. Legislation

- **Compliance with Laws:** Always consider the impact of intellectual property laws and other regulations that could influence your ISMS processes. These laws vary by country and can significantly affect how security measures are implemented and maintained.

### 4. Organization

- **Documentation and Processes:** The backbone of any ISMS includes comprehensive documentation of policies, processes, plans, incident responses, and vendor interactions. Ensuring all aspects are well-documented helps in maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.
